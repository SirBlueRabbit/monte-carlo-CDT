% implementation structures O(1), Vertex, Triangle, Observables

% Store the geometry
% Na√Øve solution: use slice structure to store a sequence of up-down
% Performing moves meaning moving triangles, meaning O(N) complexity
% Solution: store list with connectivities
% Distances are of intrest so natural to look at connectivity of vertices
% Computationally simplier is to look at connectivity of triangles
% Finally: store an ordered list where every element represents a triangle, which stores the triangle indices it is connected to, and it's type (up-down)
% In this way both moves can be done in O(1), the 4-4 move without rejection and the 2-2 flip with rejection rate of approximately 50%
