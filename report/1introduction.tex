The goal is to sample labelled triangulations $T_l$ from a distribution
\begin{equation}
    P_\lambda (T_l) = \frac{1}{Z_\lambda} \frac{1}{N_2(T_l)!} e^{- \lambda N_2(T_l)},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is a parameter related to the cosmological constant and $N_2(T_l)$ is the number of triangles in the given triangulation. Furthermore, the partition function $Z$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    Z_\lambda = \sum_{T_l} \frac{1}{N_2(T_l)!} e^{- \lambda N_2(T_l)}.
\end{equation}
It is possible to split up the partition sum into contributions with a constant number of triangles, as follows
\begin{equation}
    Z_\lambda = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{e^{- \lambda n}}{n!} \sum_{T_l^n} 1,
\end{equation}
where $T_l^n$ is a labelled triangulation made up of $n$ triangles.
