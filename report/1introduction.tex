The goal is to sample labelled triangulations $T_l$ from a distribution
\begin{equation}\label{eq:full_dist}
    p (T_l)
    =
    \frac{1}{Z} \frac{1}{N_2(T_l)!} e^{- \lambda N_2(T_l)}
    ,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is a parameter related to the cosmological constant and $N_2(T_l)$ is the number of triangles in the given triangulation. Furthermore, the partition function $Z$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    Z
    =
    \sum_{T_l} \frac{1}{N_2(T_l)!} e^{- \lambda N_2(T_l)}
    ,
\end{equation}
where the summation is over all valid labelled triangulations. It is possible to split up the partition sum into contributions with a constant number of triangles, as follows
\begin{equation}
    Z
    =
    \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \Omega(n) \frac{e^{- \lambda n}}{n!}
    ,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega(n)$ denotes the number of labelled triangulations with $n$ triangles.
