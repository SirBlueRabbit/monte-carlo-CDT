- Topic theme: What is the research area? What are the challenges in the field relevant to your project?
- Topic goal: What is the goal of your project in physics terms?
- Model: What is the precise model that you will simulate? What are the parameters (and their interpretation)?
- Implementation: What (Monte Carlo) algorithm(s) will you use? Are they described in the literature in the form you need or do they require adaptation to your problem?
- Parameter range: Given the goal of your project and the computing resources that are available to you, what ranges of parameters / lattice sizes / data points do you think are realistic?
- Data & code management: What kind of data do you intend to store? How will you store and share code and data (among each other and with us at the end of the project)?
- Data analysis: What will be the main ingredients in the data analysis (finite-size scaling, function fitting, parameter estimation, ...)? How do you intend to estimate errors (batching, bootstrap, jackknife, only working with i.i.d. random variables)?
