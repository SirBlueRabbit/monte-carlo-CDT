- Topic theme: 2D Quantum Gravity using Causal Dynamical Triangulations. Challenges include finding meaningful observables and interpreting them. 
- Topic goal: Create a MCMC that generates triangulations according to the desired distribution. Measure observables such as correlations of timeslice sizes, lightcone structure, curvature, etc. Potentially study effects of switching to a different topology or different boundary conditions.
- Model: Either a cylindrical or toroidal 2D CDT QG. Parameters include the coupling lambda (cosmological constant), number of time slices T (should be large enough in order to obtain meaningful data), number (or distribution, requiring mean and width parameter) of triangles (should also be large enough). For the cylindrical model also the spatial size of the initial and final time slice is an input parameter.
- Implementation: A MCMC model exists for our use case. However putting the data in a convenient data structure is nontrivial. If we observe long equilibration times, we can consider using a different initial condition. If time allows it, the potential for direct sampling algorithms is also considered. 
- Parameter range: This depends on our implementation, we will mainly investigate this as we go (before running our code on the cluster nodes).
- Data & code management: We use [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/SirBlueRabbit/monte-carlo-CDT) to store our code, report and data. Before we make a definitive choice of observables, we will have to store the entire triangulation. However, when we have made this choice we can save only the relevant observables for the desired timesteps. Additionally, we will save the timestep itself, as well as the input parameters.
- Data analysis: Data analysis will mainly consist of finite-size scaling approaches. Error analysis can be done using batching. The autocorrelation time is also considered.
